# The Klod Online Manifesto
## No Extortion of the Player
Klod rejects social psychology and manipulation applied to marketing and gameplay, in particular:
- engineered frustration designed to push players into “pay-to-win”;   
- in-game shops and virtual currencies.

In Klod, there will be only one form of monetization: the subscription. It is a pact of mutual independence, the price of the creators’ freedom and the guarantee of fair treatment among players.
## No Disrespect for the Player
Klod is not here to deliver yet another hollow distraction meant to “empty players’ minds.” A Klodian is a mature, responsible strategist, able to bear the weight of failure and to build success over time. They are not a “customer to retain.” They come, they play, they stay because they enjoy thinking hard. They are crowned with the glory of their victories, and they endure the consequences of their mistakes and betrayals.
## No Resale of the Player
I am not a data merchant. No ad trackers, no resale of profiles. My job (my passion) is to code video games, not to police your private life. What happens on Klod concerns only you and me, as long as it remains legal. Step outside that line, though, and beware. I will have no remorse handing you over to the competent authorities. I am the guardian of a game, not of deviants or harassers.
